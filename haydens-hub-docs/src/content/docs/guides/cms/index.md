---

Welcome to the **Content Management System (CMS) Admin Guide** for Hayden’s Hub.  
This guide will teach you how to safely manage and update the website without touching the code.

---

## 1. What is a CMS?

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a tool that allows non-technical (any) users to **update website content** without editing code.

- **Without a CMS:** Every text, url, or image change requires a developer to update it within the codebase and redeploy the site.
- **With a CMS:** Admins can log in to a dashboard, edit content, click 'Publish', and see updates live on the site.

### Why We Use Contentful

We use **[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)** as our CMS because it:

- **Separates content from code** – Developers build the website; admins manage the content.
- **Easy to update** – Edit text, images, and links without coding.
- **Safe & structured** – Content is organized in **content models** (e.g., Team Members, FAQs, Homepage).
- **Instant updates** – Once published, the site automatically fetches the latest content.
- **Supports scaling** – As the website grows, new pages and content types can be added easily.

In short: Contentful makes website updates fast, safe, and code-free.

- **Add new entries** (e.g., new blog post, FAQ, resource, or team member)
- **Upload and manage media** (images, PDFs, and other assets)
