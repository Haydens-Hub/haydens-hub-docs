title: Hayden’s Hub Journal Guidelines & TOC Structure
description: Learn how to manage all content appearing on the Hayden's Hub homepage and its related sections.
---

The **Guidelines** and **Table of Contents (TOC)** entries are the backbone of Hayden’s Hub Journal submission pages. Following **strict rules** is critical because **any incorrect setup can break the website**.

---

## Why Strict Rules Matter

* **TOC and content headings are linked together.** If a heading in your guideline content does not match the TOC slug exactly, the link will not work.
* **Consistency prevents errors.** Admins rarely need to create new TOC items; most headings already exist.
* **Unified TOC saves time.** All blog types (Academic, Advocacy, Creative, Community Spotlight, Youth Voices) **reuse the same TOC items**. Admins can skip items that don’t apply but **should avoid creating duplicates**.

> ⚠️ **Do not create new TOC items** unless confirmed with the tech team.  
> Changing TOC or headings incorrectly **can break the live site**.

## How Admins Should Use This Table

1. **When creating or editing a guideline entry**:
   * Use the **TOC Reference field** to select **from this existing list**.
   * Ensure **headings in Content Sections** match the **TOC Item Titles exactly**.

2. **When publishing new TOC item**:
   * Check the **slug** is short and unique (usually matches the title in lowercase).

3. **When skipping TOC items**:
   * If a blog type does not need a section, **leave it unselected**.
   * Do **not** create duplicate TOC items.
